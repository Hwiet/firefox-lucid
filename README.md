# Lucid

#### [<img align="right" src="https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/static/img/addons-buttons/AMO-button_2.png">](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ff-lucid/) Replace your Home & New Tab pages with a simple personal notepad and a greeting that includes the date and time of day.

### Installation:
#### Using the official Firefox Add-Ons:
1) Go to [the product page](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ff-lucid/).
2) Install it!

### Known Issues:
 - Firefox privacy/anti-fingerprinting settings prevent access to accurate Date() timezone (defaults to UTC +000) and prefers-color-scheme (defaults to light). For these cases, users need to be able to manually set preferred color scheme & timezone.
